==Common Errors==
Below is a list of reported errors that have come up, and how to fix them.

===The file pthreadGC2.dll is missing or not loaded===
This ANE depends on the POSIX Threading Library provided by GCC.  This file is extremely common, but may not be present on all copies of Windows.  It is included in this ANE package, but may need to be installed separately.  Either extract the .ANE file (it is located in the /META-INF/ane/Windows-x86 folder), or download a copy from the Downloads tab in the project.  Copy it to the following locations :

  * Windows XP(32/64), Windows Vista(32), Windows 7(32) - C:\Windows\System32\
  * Windows Vista(64), Windows 7(64) - C:\Windows\SysWOW64\

===My AIR Application or ADL.EXE crashes when the app is closing===
It is a requirement of the AIR Runtime that you call the `dispose()` function before the app ends in order to unload the ANE and all of its allocated resources.  This is extra important with this ANE as it works with file handlers that the OS will need to free up for other applications.

There are instances where the ADL will crash even though the dispose function is called.  This is a known timing issue with AIR 3.
